# RFM69_ArduinoPi
RFM69 for Raspberry Pi and Arduino

Create an Arduino setup that sends to a RaspberryPi gateway where the RFM69 is joined directly to the Raspberry Pi via the SPI bus.

BUT try to build this using the RFM69 library from LowPowerLab so it is easy to track updates into RPI.

## Tasks
1. Run `autoscan` to get an idea of what needs to go into autoconf Processing
1. Rename `configure.scan` to `configure.ac`
1. Run `autoconf`
1. Run `configure`
